# Project-Databricks-Skew-BroadcastJoin-Solutions

A Spark project analyzing broadcast joins to mitigate data skew in Databricks.

# Project: Databricks Skew Broadcast Join Solutions

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates solutions for handling **data skew** in **broadcast joins** using Apache Spark on Databricks. By analyzing the Online Retail Dataset, this project optimizes join operations to improve performance in Spark environments.

## Overview

Data skew can significantly impact the performance of join operations in distributed systems like Apache Spark. This project explores how **broadcast joins** can mitigate skew when working with small lookup tables. Using the **Online Retail Dataset** (541,909 records), we compare broadcast joins to traditional shuffle joins and analyze their effectiveness in handling skew.

### Key Objectives:

- Demonstrate how broadcast joins reduce the impact of data skew.
- Compare execution times of broadcast joins vs. shuffle joins.
- Use Spark UI metrics to highlight optimization benefits.

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/udaykotian/Project-Databricks-Skew-BroadcastJoin-Solutions.git
   ```

2. **Set up your environment**:

   - If using Databricks, import the notebook into your workspace.
   - If using a local environment, ensure you have Apache Spark and Jupyter installed.

3. **Install required libraries**:
   - PySpark (if not already installed).
   - Other dependencies as specified in the notebook (if applicable).
